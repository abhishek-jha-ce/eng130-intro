# DevOps Intro - Week #1

#### Summary of Week#1 Learnings
This week was classified as business week and we learned mostly soft skills. At the end of the week we installed python and pycharm on our machines.


## Elevator Pitch

We created an elevator pitch and we present it to our cohorts. An Elevator Pitch is defined as a short description of an idea, product, or company that explains the concept in a way such that any listener can understand it in a short period of time. It's a brief way of introducing ourselves and getting across key points. We need to have a good pitch for ourselves when we are interviewed by the client. Some Key points of a good Elevator Pitch:

- Between 30 Seconds to 2 Minutes, but ideally 60 - 90 Seconds.
- Highlight Achievements.
- Use Buzzwords.
- Be Confident, Use suitable tone and body language.
- Include your hobbies.

We received detailed constructive feedback about our pitch. 

## How to make a good presentation

We had to give presentation about devops in group. Our initial presentataion was not up to mark and we received feedback on how to improve it. Some key points include:

- Be confident and smile when presenting.
- Maintain eye contact and good body language.
- Less is more - Don't put in too many bullet points or texts.
- Use picture where possible instead of text, each slide should have atleast one.
- Don't read the script or sound like reading a script.
- Speak clearly and concisely.
- Keep the audience engaged.

## Interview Practice

We were allocated different groups and we had to interview each other and give feedback on how it went and how to improve on our interview skills further. It was very helpful as it gave us the chance to practice our skills and received feedback on how to improve it.
